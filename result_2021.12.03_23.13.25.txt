潜水、恐慌、共鸣（第一部分）

I thought panic attacks were for fragile hysterical people that can’t deal with life. I had never had one.
我以为恐慌症是脆弱的歇斯底里的人，不能处理生活。我从来没有过这样的经历。

I was visiting Iceland when I looked into a lake and saw how incredibly clear the water was. I thought, “Oooooh. I want to scuba dive in there!”
我在访问冰岛时，看着一个湖，看到湖水是如此的清澈，令人难以置信。我想，"哦哦哦。我想在那里潜水！"

I had never been scuba diving, so I found a place where I could take a week of lessons, get certified, then dive in that spot.
我从来没有做过水肺潜水，所以我找到一个地方，在那里我可以上一周的课，获得证书，然后在那个地方潜水。

The lessons were great. You learn hand signals to communicate underwater. The main two signals are the classic “OK” hand, and wobbling your flat hand to say “SOMETHING WRONG”.
课程很好。你要学习水下交流的手势。主要的两个信号是经典的 "OK "手势，以及晃动你的平手表示 "SOMETHING WRONG"。

The first time we went underwater, in a swimming pool, I found it so tranquil and relaxing.
我们第一次进入水下，在一个游泳池里，我发现它是如此宁静和放松。

But when you go into the icy ocean, you have to wear a dry suit over the wetsuit. The wetsuit is hard to get on, pulling with all your strength to get that thick neoprene foam over you. Then with that restricted mobility, you have to put on the dry suit, which is like an astronaut’s space suit. It was really uncomfortable and claustrophobic.
但是当你进入冰冷的海洋时，你必须在潜水服外面穿上干式套装。潜水服是很难穿上的，你要用尽全身力气拉着厚厚的氯丁橡胶泡沫，才能把它套在身上。然后，由于行动受限，你必须穿上干衣，这就像宇航员的太空服。这真的很不舒服，而且有幽闭恐惧症。

We got into the ocean, and started diving down. But when the water got darker, I was overcome with an urge to get out of there. I just wanted to be on the phone with my friend Meredith. I wanted to have my laptop on my lap, with a cup of tea, and answer emails. I wanted to be back at my hotel. More than anything, I wanted to talk with a friend. Right now! That’s it! I’m leaving!我们进入了大海，开始往下潜。但是当水变得更黑时，我被一种想要离开那里的冲动所征服。我只想和我的朋友梅雷迪斯通电话。我想把我的笔记本电脑放在腿上，喝杯茶，回答电子邮件。我想回到我的酒店。更重要的是，我想和一个朋友聊天。就现在！就现在 就这样吧！我走了。我要走了!
